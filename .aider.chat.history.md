I need a bit more detail before I can edit the files.  
Which of the three app concepts would you like to build (Daily Micro‑Habit Builder, Random Creativity Prompt, or Life Goals & Bucket List)?  
Once I know the chosen app, I can update the metadata title/description and create the logo‑todo file.
